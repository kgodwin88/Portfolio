                            My name is Kevin and I am currently an Automotive Technician for Audi that it trying to make my way into the web developement community.  I am eager to start my career as a Full Stack Web Developer and use my problem solving skills that i developed as a Technician to solve difficult problems with web based applications. I have 
                            knowledge with html, css, javascript, node.js, express.js, handlebars, Mysql, Mongodb, and React.  I am always eager to increase my knowledge to improve my ablitities to become a better web developer.
                        </p>
                            
                        <p>
                            My formal web development training comes from a Full Stack Web Development course that I took at the University of North Carolina in Charlotte, NC.  I have learned many new techlogies through this courese but the technology that I most enjoyed learning would be anything that deals with javascript.
